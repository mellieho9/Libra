# Libra
An app that combats stigmas surrounding therapy and tracks users' mental well-being 

## Background
*This project is an entry to HackDuke: Code for Good*
For many cultures, seeking therapy is frowned upon. 
Mental health is an increasingly urgent global issue, yet seeking therapy remains challenging. On the one hand, this is because people still struggle greatly with accepting that they need mental support. Many cultures continue to discount mental illnesses and stigmatize those with so. On the other hand, therapy is not accessible to everyone. 

Introducing Libra, a therapy-booking app that resolves the above problem with three key features:
1. **Daily check-in** - When the user creates an account, they are prompted to answer questions from the DSM-5 criteria (official criteria to identify mental illness) in the initial check-up questions. Based on the response, the app generates an emotional happiness rating and suggests the user seek therapy through the application (if required). If the user chooses to seek therapy, they will be directed to pick one of their suggested therapists, meeting time, and communication method. Otherwise, the app will continue to give the user daily mood checks. If itâ€™s below 50% for a long period of time, the app will prompt another suggestion for therapy.
2. **In-app real-time messaging function** - The application features a function for the user to safely text and express their conditions to a licensed therapist if the user does not want to see the therapist face-to-face. By implementing the function, we have provided a more gentle and immediate way for users who are in need, no matter when or where they are.
3. **In-app video chat** - The application features a private video feature that allows the user to connect directly with their therapist. The user can refer to it and the summary notes given by the therapist after the session is over in the history tab. This makes it easier for them to keep track of their discussions with the therapist.

## Future implementations
1. Deployment of an AI model to mathc users with therapists specific to their needs
2. Utilization of AssemblyAI to convert therapy content to text
3. Employment of licensed therapists from every time zones
4. Automatic alerts to local therapists/hospitals if detects high-level stress and/or sadness in users
